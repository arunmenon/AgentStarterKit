# SPEAKING NOTES: WHAT IS AN AI AGENT?

## OPENING (Cell 1)
- "Welcome to our foundational module on AI agents. In the next 15 minutes, we'll demystify what truly makes an AI system 'agentic'."
- "By the end, you'll understand the key properties that differentiate agents from traditional AI systems, trace their rapid evolution, and design your own agent architecture."
- "The best part? No prior experience required - we're building from first principles."

## THE AI SPECTRUM (Cell 2)
- "AI systems exist on a spectrum from reactive to agentic - it's not binary but a continuum of capabilities."
- "At the reactive end, we have chatbots that simply match patterns and respond. At the agentic end, we have autonomous systems making independent decisions."
- "Consider systems you're familiar with: GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Siri - they occupy different positions on this spectrum based on their autonomy and capabilities."
- "The key question isn't 'Is this an agent?' but rather 'How agentic is this system?'"

## SPECTRUM VISUALIZATION (Cell 3)
- "This visualization maps the progression from basic pattern-matching to coordinated autonomy."
- "Notice how each step adds capability: Rule-based chatbots merely match patterns, while ChatGPT understands context but still requires explicit direction."
- "GitHub Copilot begins to show proactivity by suggesting completions, while AutoGPT demonstrates goal-orientation by working toward objectives."
- "The final stage - multi-agent systems - introduces coordination between multiple autonomous components."

## THE 5 KEY PROPERTIES (Cell 4)
- "Five essential properties transform an AI system into a true agent. I call these the PAGR+ framework:"
- "Autonomy - the ability to make decisions without human intervention. Think of AutoGPT deciding which API to call next."
- "Goal-orientation - working toward specific objectives and decomposing complex goals into actionable steps."
- "Persistence - maintaining state across interactions, remembering context and progress over time."
- "Reactivity - responding dynamically to environmental changes and adapting plans based on feedback."
- "Proactivity - taking initiative to achieve goals, anticipating needs before they're explicitly stated."

## PROPERTY VISUALIZATION (Cell 5)
- "These radar charts visualize the 'agentic profile' of different systems. Notice the dramatic difference."
- "AutoGPT shows high scores across all five properties, especially goal-orientation and autonomy."
- "ChatGPT, while powerful, scores much lower - particularly in persistence and goal-orientation."
- "This quantitative approach helps us objectively measure and compare agent capabilities."

## THE AGENT CONTROL LOOP (Cell 6)
- "Every agent, regardless of complexity, follows this fundamental loop: Sense, Think, Act, Learn."
- "Sense: The agent perceives its environment and gathers information."
- "Think: It processes this information, reasons about goals, and plans actions."
- "Act: The agent executes decisions, using tools or APIs to modify its environment."
- "Learn: Finally, it updates its knowledge and improves strategies based on outcomes."
- "This cycle repeats continuously, allowing the agent to progressively improve its performance."

## EVOLUTION TIMELINE (Cell 7-8)
- "The evolution of agent architectures has been remarkably rapid, occurring in three distinct phases."
- "2023 was the Foundation Year - when AutoGPT launched as the first viral autonomous agent, followed by BabyAGI, Voyager, and Google's Concordia."
- "2024 became the Pattern Year - when architectures like ReAct, ReWOO, and Reflexion standardized agent behavior patterns."
- "2025 is the Production Year - marked by OpenAI's o3 achieving 87.5% on ARC-AGI, followed by agent operating systems and advanced memory frameworks."
- "We've witnessed exponential growth - from zero to over 230,000 organizations building agents in just two years."

## AGENT DESIGN EXERCISE (Cell 9-10)
- "Agent design begins with five fundamental questions:"
- "What is your agent's goal? This defines its purpose and scope."
- "What tools does it need to accomplish this goal? These are its capabilities."
- "How will it maintain state? This determines what information persists between interactions."
- "What triggers its actions? These are the conditions that cause the agent to respond."
- "How will it improve over time? This defines the learning mechanism."
- "Our example ResearchBot demonstrates this framework in practice, with clear goals, tools, state management, triggers, and learning mechanisms."

## REALITY CHECK (Cell 11)
- "Let's ground our excitement with some reality: current agents have significant limitations."
- "While adoption is rapid, today's agents can only successfully complete about 24% of complex workplace tasks."
- "Even GPT-4 succeeds less than 50% of the time on benchmark tasks, far below human performance."
- "But progress is accelerating - by 2026, we expect 82% of organizations to be using agents for tasks like email, coding, and data analysis."
- "Our collective goal: move from 24% to 80%+ task completion in the next generation."

## CLOSING (Cell 12)
- "To summarize: Agents differ from chatbots through five key properties - autonomy, goal-orientation, persistence, reactivity, and proactivity."
- "All agents follow the Sense→Think→Act→Learn control loop, regardless of their complexity."
- "We're witnessing exponential evolution: from foundation (2023) to patterns (2024) to production (2025)."
- "In our next session, we'll move from theory to practice by building a complete ReAct agent from scratch."
- "Thank you for your attention. Questions?"
