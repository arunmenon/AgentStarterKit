# Agent Starter Kit - Speaking Notes

This directory contains comprehensive speaking notes for all notebooks in the Agent Starter Kit curriculum. These notes are designed for instructors and presenters to effectively communicate the key concepts, implementation details, and learning objectives of each notebook.

## Organization

The speaking notes are organized by chapter, following the same structure as the main repository:

```
notes/
├── README.md                     # This file
├── chapter_1/                    # Agent Foundations speaking notes
├── chapter_2/                    # Memory & Learning speaking notes
├── chapter_3/                    # Tool Integration speaking notes
└── chapter_4/                    # Planning & Goals speaking notes
```

Each chapter directory contains speaking notes for all notebooks in that chapter, with filenames corresponding to the notebook they cover.
