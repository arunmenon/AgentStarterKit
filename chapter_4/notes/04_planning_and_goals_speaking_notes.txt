# SPEAKING NOTES: PLANNING AND GOALS

## WHY PLANNING IS ESSENTIAL FOR AGENTIC SYSTEMS
- "Planning is the cornerstone of truly agentic AI systems. Without it, agents can only react to immediate stimuli or follow pre-defined scripts."
- "With planning capabilities, agents can set and pursue long-term goals, moving beyond simple reactivity to deliberate action sequences."
- "Planning allows agents to allocate limited resources optimally, handling time, computational resources, and domain-specific constraints."
- "It enables agents to handle contingencies and failures, adapting when initial approaches don't succeed."
- "Planning helps agents balance exploration versus exploitation, deciding when to follow known strategies versus trying new approaches."
- "Perhaps most importantly, planning allows agents to coordinate complex multi-step activities by breaking overwhelming tasks into manageable chunks."
- "The Hierarchical Task Network approach we'll explore represents one of the most powerful planning paradigms for real-world applications."

## CORE PLANNING CONCEPTS
- "Hierarchical Decomposition breaks complex goals into manageable steps, like how a store manager breaks down 'prepare for holiday season' into department-specific tasks."
- "Task Dependencies determine what must happen before other things can start, like how inventory must be ordered before displays can be set up."
- "Resource Constraints manage limited resources like staff, budget, and space across competing priorities, just as real managers must do."
- "Adaptive Execution involves monitoring and adjusting plans when reality doesn't match expectations, similar to how retail managers react to unexpected events."
- "Learning from Execution means storing experiences to improve future planning, mimicking how experienced retail managers get better over time."

## INTRODUCTION (Cell 0-1)
- "Welcome to our final module on Planning and Goals - the capstone of our agent development curriculum."
- "In previous modules, we built agents with memory, reasoning, and tool integration. Now we'll enable them to tackle complex, multi-step objectives."
- "Planning represents the highest level of agent capability - decomposing goals into subgoals, identifying dependencies, and orchestrating execution."
- "The techniques we'll cover transform agents from simple task executors to strategic problem solvers that can manage complex workflows."
- "By the end of this module, you'll understand hierarchical planning systems and be able to implement agents that handle problems requiring dozens of coordinated steps."
- "We've chosen Walmart retail operations as our domain because it presents realistic planning challenges - from Black Friday coordination to seasonal transitions."
- "These retail scenarios will demonstrate how our planning system handles time constraints, resource limitations, and unexpected disruptions."

## ENVIRONMENT SETUP (Cell 2-3)
- "As with previous modules, we're using our Ollama integration with Qwen2.5 7B for consistency."
- "Our imports include essential libraries for planning systems: datetime for temporal constraints, defaultdict and deque for efficient data structures, and uuid for unique task identification."
- "The visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, networkx) will help us create intuitive representations of complex plans."
- "We're using dataclasses extensively in this module to create clean, structured representations of planning concepts."
- "Notice how we import typing annotations like List, Dict, Optional, and Tuple - these will help ensure our planning objects maintain correct structure."
- "We're continuing with our Walmart retail context, which provides realistic planning challenges."
- "The Ollama connection test ensures we have LLM capabilities for intelligent plan decomposition."

## HIERARCHICAL TASK NETWORKS (Cell 4-5)
- "The foundation of our planning system starts with clear type definitions using Python's Enum class."
- "TaskType distinguishes between ABSTRACT tasks (like 'Prepare for Black Friday') that need further decomposition and PRIMITIVE tasks (like 'Call extra staff') that can be executed directly."
- "TaskStatus tracks execution progression from PENDING through READY and RUNNING to either COMPLETED or FAILED, with BLOCKED for resource constraints."
- "ResourceType enumerates the six resource categories in retail: STAFF, INVENTORY, BUDGET, SPACE, TIME, and EQUIPMENT."
- "The Resource class implements capacity management with allocate() and release() methods that enforce constraints."
- "Our Task dataclass is the core building block, with 20+ attributes covering identification, execution properties, dependencies, resources, scheduling, and outcomes."
- "The can_start() method performs three critical checks: dependency satisfaction, resource availability, and time constraints."
- "Method objects define decomposition strategies - each method has a name pattern it applies to, preconditions, and a list of subtask templates."
- "The Plan class ties everything together, storing tasks, resources, order, and metrics like estimated duration and success probability."
- "Notice how the Plan.get_ready_tasks() method returns tasks sorted by priority - this ensures critical tasks execute first when resources are limited."
- "The _calculate_critical_path method (simplified here) would normally implement the Critical Path Method algorithm from project management."

## INTELLIGENT PLANNER WITH LLM (Cell 6)
- "Our OllamaLLM class provides a clean interface to the language model with temperature control and error handling."
- "The WalmartHTNPlanner is our central planning class, integrating structured planning with LLM intelligence."
- "We initialize three retail-specific planning methods: Black Friday preparation, inventory planning, and store layout setup."
- "Each method contains detailed subtasks with specific departments, durations, and resource requirements."
- "The decompose_goal method is our entry point - it analyzes the goal, creates a plan object, initializes resources, and starts recursive decomposition."
- "In _analyze_goal_context, we use the LLM to extract key context like event_type, urgency, and departments - with fallback parsing for robustness."
- "The _initialize_resources method creates our resource pool - 100 staff, $100,000 budget, 50,000 sq ft of space, 50 equipment units, and 168 hours (1 week)."
- "_decompose_task recursively breaks down abstract tasks, with depth limiting to prevent infinite recursion."
- "The method selection in _find_applicable_method checks both name patterns and context preconditions."
- "When no method is found, _llm_decompose uses the LLM to create a fallback decomposition - this makes our planner flexible for novel situations."
- "The _topological_sort method implements a breadth-first search to order tasks respecting all dependencies - a classic graph algorithm."
- "This hybrid approach combines the reliability of predefined methods with the flexibility of LLM-based reasoning."

## PLAN VISUALIZATION (Cell 7-8)
- "Our visualize_plan function creates a comprehensive 2×2 dashboard of the plan with four coordinated views."
- "The first quadrant uses NetworkX to create a directed graph of task dependencies, with node colors indicating departments."
- "The graph layout uses spring_layout with k=2 for better spacing and 50 iterations for stability."
- "The second quadrant creates a simplified Gantt chart showing task timing, with tasks ordered by execution sequence."
- "We use overlapping tasks (with the 0.5 multiplier on current_time) to represent parallel execution possibilities."
- "The third quadrant shows resource allocation with side-by-side bars comparing required versus available capacity."
- "Notice the annotation code that adds exact numeric labels to the resource bars."
- "The fourth quadrant displays plan metrics and department involvement, with a custom legend for the color scheme."
- "The department breakdown shows exactly how many tasks each department is responsible for, highlighting organizational impact."
- "These visualizations transform abstract planning structures into intuitive representations that reveal patterns and bottlenecks."

## ADAPTIVE PLAN EXECUTION (Cell 9-10)
- "Our AdaptivePlanExecutor class implements a sophisticated execution engine with 200+ lines of code for monitoring and adaptation."
- "The execute_plan method runs the main execution loop, tracking metrics like completion rate, costs, and replanning events."
- "The execution flow follows: get ready tasks → check for deadlocks → execute highest priority task → track outcomes → release resources."
- "_has_pending_tasks and _detect_deadlock implement the condition checking for the main loop."
- "_allocate_resources and _release_resources handle resource management, ensuring constraints are respected."
- "The _execute_task method simulates task execution with realistic variation - durations vary by ±20% and success probability uses randomization."
- "We add variety to failure modes with different error types: resource shortage, system failure, staff unavailability, supplier delay, and quality issues."
- "_should_replan uses three criteria: high priority tasks (≥8), tasks with many dependents (>2), or tasks on the critical path."
- "The _replan method implements three strategies: removing dependencies from failed tasks, reducing resource requirements, or creating alternative tasks."
- "For integration with memory systems, _store_execution_memory would connect to Module 2's episodic memory."
- "The execution log captures 8 key metrics and detailed event history for post-execution analysis."
- "This approach balances stability with adaptability - essential for real-world applications with changing conditions."

## RETAIL PLANNING SCENARIOS (Cell 11-15)
- "We test our planning system with three realistic retail scenarios that demonstrate different capabilities."
- "Scenario 1: Black Friday preparation coordinates inventory, staffing, and store layout for a major sales event."
- "We visualize the Black Friday plan to see task dependencies, timeline, resource usage, and department involvement."
- "The execution code simulates running the plan and handles failure analysis if the success rate falls below 80%."
- "Scenario 2: Emergency inventory management handles a popular toy shortage before Christmas."
- "The context includes time constraints ('48 hours') and high urgency for this emergency situation."
- "We print the top 5 tasks in the emergency plan to show how the system prioritizes critical actions."
- "Scenario 3: Seasonal transition planning shows resource analysis capabilities."
- "We calculate total resource requirements across all tasks and compare against capacity."
- "The utilization percentage calculation flags resources with >80% utilization as potential bottlenecks."
- "These examples demonstrate how our planning approach handles diverse retail challenges with appropriate specificity and adaptation."

## HANDS-ON EXERCISE (Cell 16-17)
- "The exercise challenges you to create a customer service crisis response method for viral social media complaints about checkout lines."
- "Your create_customer_service_method function should return a Method object with appropriate preconditions and subtasks."
- "The example solution provides a 7-step approach with carefully prioritized tasks (10 to 4)."
- "Immediate response tasks get highest priority: acknowledging on social media (10) and opening all registers (9)."
- "Short-term fixes get medium priority: express lanes (8), additional cashiers (7), and queue management (6)."
- "Long-term improvements get lower priority: staff training (5) and resolution updates (4)."
- "Resource requirements are specified for each task: staff, budget, equipment, and space."
- "After creating the method, we add it to the planner's method library and test it with a relevant goal."
- "The output shows the plan's metrics: task count, estimated duration, and cost."
- "This exercise demonstrates how domain knowledge can be encoded into planning methods for rapid response to common scenarios."

## INTEGRATION WITH PREVIOUS MODULES (Cell 18-20)
- "Our IntegratedRetailAgent class combines planning, memory, and tool capabilities into a complete agent."
- "The class shows commented references to Module 2's memory system and Module 1's tools - in a full implementation, these would be active integrations."
- "The handle_retail_goal method implements a 5-step pipeline: understand → plan → execute → learn → report."
- "Step 1 would retrieve relevant memories from past similar situations (using Module 2's retrieval)."
- "Step 2 creates the execution plan using our HTN planner."
- "Step 3 executes the plan with the adaptive executor."
- "Step 4 extracts learnings from the execution through _learn_from_execution."
- "The learning system identifies three types of patterns: failure patterns, successful plan structures, and resource optimization opportunities."
- "Step 5 generates a comprehensive report with metrics, department involvement, key achievements, issues, and recommendations."
- "The _generate_recommendations method creates actionable insights based on execution metrics."
- "We test the integrated agent with a complex goal: 'Optimize store operations for holiday shopping season while maintaining regular customer satisfaction'."
- "The final report shows all execution metrics formatted for readability, with percentages, dollar amounts, and time values properly displayed."
- "This integration creates a complete agent system that combines reasoning, memory, tool use, and planning into a cohesive whole."
